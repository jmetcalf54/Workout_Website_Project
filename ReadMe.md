This is a personal project that is being used to
improve my coding and developer skills by honing
in on two things that I enjoy: Working out and helping
people.

I am hoping that this project can be used in the future
potentially for clients but being that I am not qualified
in the sense of excercise science and I am only going off
of my own experience, I hope that I can still create something
that could be useful to myself or potential future users.
